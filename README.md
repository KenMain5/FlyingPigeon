<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>This project is primarily focused on exploring Apache Kafka, followed by learning how to integrate and use the CI tool Jenkins. It is designed with a monolithic architecture and initially, it does not include a database. The application will start with two main entities and will follow the roadmap below. If you have suggestions for improvements or would like to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request. I'm always open to new ideas and collaboration! </p>
